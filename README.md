# 22S_NaverShopping
This repository contains the preprocess code and the graph embedding & clustering code I participated in the Naver Shopping (https://shopping.naver.com/home) project jointly conducted by SNU Graduate school of Data Science and UX lab during the summer of 2022. I joined the project as an undergraduate intern through the SNU AI Institute summer internship program (https://aiis.snu.ac.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=sub5_1&wr_id=334), where I contributed to the data preprocessing task and the session clustering task based on the GED(Graph Edit Distance) estimation with GNN(Graph Neural Network) approach. 

Most of the input data and analysis results are hidden for the privacy and data confidentiality issues. For the graph clustering based on GED, I mostly referred to SimGNN (https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/SimGNN) method. This methodology was originally devised to simulate the GED computation, which is the NP-Hard problem, in a reasonable time using the neural networks. I used the output values of the convolution layers within this model in order to obtain the embeddings of each sessions(graphs). Comparing to the other methods conducted within the project, it turned out to show similar results to the most of the embedding methods(including sequential clustering and AutoEncoder clustering) as well.
